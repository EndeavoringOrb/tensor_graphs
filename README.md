# tensor_graphs

I want to make a language that can be used to describe mathematic functions (like LLMs or diffusion models). The idea being that if I can decompose LLMs and diffusion models down into basic operations like addition, multiplication, dot products, then I can make a system for automatic optimization. Like I can write an optimized addition+multiplication CUDA kernel and then that can be applied to every LLM and diffusion model that uses that combination. I also want to be able to symbolically rearrange stuff so I can test out different dependancy graphs to see if I can increase parallelism and in turn increase speed. Then this can also be combined with LLMs to automatically generate new fused kernels because we have reference implementations for the atomic operations (add, mul, dot, etc).
