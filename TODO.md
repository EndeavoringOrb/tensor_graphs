- make sure tensor_graphs/ops/atomic/* uses attrs for constant inputs instead of input nodes
- decide whether to make shape_inference handle all out shape stuff, right now some tensor_graphs/ops/atomic/* ref functions set output shape
- should_debug = DEBUG_EXECUTION and op_type in ["RoPE", "Repeat"]
- in compilation should shape inference go after constant folding?
